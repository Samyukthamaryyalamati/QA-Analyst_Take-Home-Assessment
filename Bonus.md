## Process Improvement
**Use Gherkin Language Format for Test Cases**
    -I recommend writing test cases in Gherkin format (Given-When-Then). It makes tests easy to understand for
     everyone and will help a lot when moving to automation testing later, as these scripts can be reused in tools like Cucumber.


## Exploratory Testing Approach

**how I approach exploratory testing**
   -When I do exploratory testing, I start by noting down the feature I need to test by reading the requirements. Then, I list out positive, negative, and edge case scenarios that I can possibly test. After that, I play around with the feature to see if anything behaves unexpectedly. While testing, I also write down each step side-by-side to make sure I'm not missing anything. I keep track of bugs as I find them, prioritize any major issues, and adapt my testing if I discover new areas to explore. At the end, I double-check everything before filing the bugs.
